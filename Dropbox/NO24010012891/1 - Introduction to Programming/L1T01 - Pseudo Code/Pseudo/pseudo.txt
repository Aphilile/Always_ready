Algorithm 1: Find the Largest Number

Set largestNumber to 0

Repeat:
    Prompt user for a positive number (Enter 0 to finish)
    Read userInput
    If userInput is greater than largestNumber:
        Set largestNumber to userInput
Until userInput is 0

If largestNumber is greater than 0:
    Print "The largest number entered is " + largestNumber
Else:
    Print "No positive number was entered"

Algorithm 2: Greet the User

Prompt user for their name
Read userName
assign userName to first_name
 Print "Hello, World" + first_name

Algorithm 3: Calculate Average

Set average to 0
Set sum to 0
Set count to 0

Repeat:
    Prompt user for an integer (Enter 0 to finish)
    Read userInput
    If userInput is not 0:
        Add userInput to sum
        Increment count
Until userInput is 0

If count is greater than 0:
    Set average to sum divided by count
    Print "The average of the entered numbers is " + average
Else:
    Print "No numbers were entered"

Algorithm 4: Manage Grocery List

Create an empty list called groceryList

Repeat:
    Prompt user for a grocery item (Enter 'done' to finish)
    Read userInput
    If userInput is not "done":
        Add userInput to groceryList
Until userInput is "done"

Sort groceryList alphabetically

If size of groceryList is greater than 0:
    Print "Items to buy:"
    For each item in groceryList:
        Print item
Else:
    Print "No items to buy"

Algorithm 5: 
 Set S to 0
 Set A to 0
 Set P to 0
 Set X to 0
 Set Y to 0

 prompt the user to enter X,Y
  S equal to X plus Y
  A equal to S divided by 2
  P equal to X multiply by Y
output S,A,P
