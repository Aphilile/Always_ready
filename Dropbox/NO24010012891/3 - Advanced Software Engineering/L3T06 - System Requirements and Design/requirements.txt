***Ambiguities and Omissions***

[User Interface Details:]
-The requirements do not specify how the user interacts with the system. Is it a touchscreen, physical buttons, or voice commands?

[Error Handling:]
-What happens if the credit card is invalid? How many attempts are allowed for entering the personal identifier? Is there a timeout for user inactivity?

[Security Measures:]
-How is the personal identification number handled and stored? What encryption standards are used for credit card information?

[Payment Processing:]
-Which payment processors or gateways are supported? How are transaction errors or declines managed?

[Ticket Issuance:]
-How is the ticket delivered to the user? Is it a physical ticket printed on the spot, or a digital ticket sent via email or SMS?

[System Maintenance:]
-What procedures are in place for system updates, backups, and recovery?

[Accessibility:]
-Are there provisions for users with disabilities? Is the system compatible with assistive technologies?

[Scalability and Performance:]
-How many transactions can the system handle simultaneously? What is the expected response time for each transaction?
